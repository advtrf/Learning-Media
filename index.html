            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello evtideryone! My name is Fauzan Ahmad, I am an undergraduate student in the International Program on Science Education at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia. My academic focus centers on science education, instructional design, and the integration of technology into classroom learning.

            <h2>Academic & Teaching Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I have engaged in microteaching practice and private tutoring, focusing on structured explanation and guided inquiry. I also developed an augmented reality (AR) project titled <em>PlanetARy</em>, integrating 3D visualization to enhance astronomy learning.

            <h2>Educational Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                Effective science learning encourages curiosity, inquiry, and critical thinking. Technology should function as a cognitive tool that enhances conceptual understanding and visualization.

            <h2>Purpose of This Website</h2>
            <p>
                This platform is designed to support junior high school students in understanding science through structured materials and interactive components.

            <h2>Why I Chose HTML and GitHub</h2>
            <p>
                I chose HTML (HyperText Markup Language) because it is the fundamental structure of every website. HTML allows content to be organized clearly and systematically using standardized web elements. It is lightweight, universally supported by browsers, and provides a strong foundation for further development with CSS and JavaScript. By using HTML, I can fully understand how web pages are structured and rendered. I chose GitHub as a development and hosting platform because it provides reliable version control and makes project management more organized. Through GitHub Pages, the website can be published online efficiently without additional infrastructure. Moreover, GitHub is widely used in the software development industry, making it a relevant and practical choice for building technical skills and maintaining transparency in the development process.
